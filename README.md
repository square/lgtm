# LGTM

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/square/lgtm.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

LGTM is a simple JavaScript library for validating objects and collecting error
messages. It leaves the display, behavior, and error messages in your hands,
focusing on letting you describe your validations cleanly and concisely for
whatever environment you're using.

For examples, installation, setup and more [see the wiki](https://github.com/square/lgtm/wiki).
